Major tasks
  - Working with appropriate pixels of images
  - Proper evaluation of maths behind steganography
  - Resizing cover images to scale out same as image to be hidden
  - Note:
    - SimpleImage is an extra JS object type used from [library.js](https://github.com/OmkarPh/Steganography/blob/master/Actual%20Project/library.js) which helps to access individual pixels and draw images to canvas
